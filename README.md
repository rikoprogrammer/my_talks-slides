# my_talks-slides

This repository contains slides of various talks and presentations that I have been making and continue to make whenever I am invited to speak at various events.

The first talk/presentation was done on 25th of Feb 2025 at DTE consultancy. The title of the talk was **"Applications of Statistics In Research Trials"**. The talk explored various aspects of conducting research in general but also more specifically in the context of clinical trials, looking at how we can apply statistical methods alongside statistical software to better design experiments and analyse data that emerges from these experiments.
